1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,059
[gentle serene music] Before we pray,
I would like to say

2
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:06,320
a few words, and then we will pray

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,140
together. There are countless things
that can go wrong in your

4
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,900
day if you choose not to begin it with
prayer.

5
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:17,820
Of course, challenges
and difficulties can still arise

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,960
even when you do pray in the morning.

7
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:23,760
However, the difference is
that starting your day with prayer

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,880
brings a peace that surpasses human
understanding.

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,680
When you pray, there
is a special grace upon you.

10
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,600
You're able to handle situations with
confidence because you know that you

11
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:39,160
have a God who is working through you,
in you, and for you.

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:43,340
God already knows what we will face each
day before we even open our

13
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,320
eyes.
So why not take a few moments to connect

14
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,540
guidance?
Why not spend a little time asking for His

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,750
direction?
Why not take a moment to ask for His

16
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,760
protection?
Taking those few moments to pray can make

17
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,720
difference in how you handle the ups
and downs of the day.

18
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,519
Let's pray together.

19
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,560
Dear Lord, I come before you today
and place this

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,460
entire day into your loving hands.

21
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:16,400
I ask for your wonderful grace,
your calming peace, and your

22
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,400
strong protection to be with me throughout
every moment of this

23
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:23,260
day.
Please guide me away from any temptations

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,140
wrong paths that might come my way.

25
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,820
Give me the strength
and the grace to keep my heart pure

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,760
anything that isn't good for me
or pleasing to you.

27
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,380
Lord,
I ask that you take control of my heart.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,360
Help me manage my emotions
and thoughts so that they stay focused on

29
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,380
is right and true.
Let your presence be so real and clear

30
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:47,720
to me today that I have no reason to fear
anything.

31
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:51,740
Instead,
help me walk confidently with complete

32
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,860
you, the God of the heavens,
are watching over me.

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,370
I pray that nothing can separate me from
you today.

34
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:02,450
Teach me how to follow your ways
and make the right choices so that every

35
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,540
step I take leads me closer to you.
I want to feel your love

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,250
surrounding me and be aware of your
powerful presence in everything I

37
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:13,820
do and everywhere I go. I ask for the

38
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,540
protection of Jesus' blood to cover me
and my family.

39
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,300
May your divine pillar of fire be seen
where my family and I live each

40
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,040
night,
forming a protective barrier around us

41
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,940
safe from all harm. Father, I pray for a

42
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,800
hedge of protection around me at my job,
and I ask for your divine

43
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,820
protection as I travel in my car. Lord

44
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,540
Jesus,
please surround me with your love and

45
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:42,530
safety. Give me the strength
and courage to face whatever

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,160
this day may bring. Lord,
I don't know what

47
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:50,180
challenges or opportunities lie ahead
today, but I trust that you will

48
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:51,980
be with me every step of the way.

49
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,090
Please guide my steps today in a direction
that leads to peace and

50
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,800
happiness. Strengthen my heart so
that I can follow your

51
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,480
commandments and walk in obedience to your
Word.

52
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:07,350
I ask for your grace
and mercy to guide me from heaven,

53
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,100
wise choices. You are my provider,
my Jehovah

54
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,810
Jireh.
You are the one who makes a way

55
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,870
way. Be my strong tower, my protector, and

56
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,750
my master. I ask for peace of mind
and peace within my

57
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:26,290
heart. Help me to stay calm and focused,
no matter what

58
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,170
happens. Father, I have faith that you
are working

59
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,609
everything together for my good.
Please silence every

60
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:36,310
confusing or negative voice from the
enemy.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:40,690
You are a God who loves us so much,
and even when you are working

62
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,340
behind the scenes in ways I cannot see
or understand, I will

63
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:48,300
continue to trust you.
I will keep my faith strong because your

64
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,080
ways are higher and greater than ours.

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,020
Protect me from any selfish
or careless thoughts, words, or actions

66
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,390
that don't bring glory to you.

67
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,020
Keep me from being distracted
or discouraged by the devil.

68
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,940
Shield me from the influence of any
negative or discouraging

69
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:07,360
people. Help me to stay positive
and focused on

70
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,240
you. Father, I am so thankful for the

71
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,920
gift of this new day. Waking up
and having the

72
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,899
chance to start fresh is such a blessing.

73
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:21,660
I am filled with joy
and gratitude for this opportunity.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,090
May your presence, Lord,
shine brightly in my life today

75
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:28,740
and set my heart on fire with love for
you, Jesus.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,250
Let your light guide me
and fill me with passion and

77
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:36,280
devotion. Father, I ask
that you open doors for

78
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,280
me today. Open doors of opportunity
that will lead to positive

79
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,080
changes and breakthroughs in my life.

80
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,000
Show me the paths I should take,
and give me the courage to step through

81
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:50,620
doors with confidence. Help me to see
and seize the

82
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,540
opportunities you place before me.

83
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,560
Lord, help me to walk by faith
and not just by

84
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:01,550
what I see around me.
Teach me to trust in your Word and

85
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:04,620
promises,
even when things seem uncertain or

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,580
challenging.
Help me to rely on your truth and not be

87
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,800
swayed by my feelings or circumstances.

88
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:15,760
I commit myself and my family into your
loving and protective hands.

89
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:19,900
Watch over us and guide us throughout this
day.

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,400
Keep us safe,
and help us to stay close to you in

91
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,060
do. In the name of Jesus,
I bless your holy

92
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,010
name. I am grateful for your endless love,
grace, and

93
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,960
mercy.
Thank you for always being there for us

94
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:37,750
our lives in ways we can't always see.

95
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:41,800
In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.
If this prayer

96
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,260
has touched your heart, please type amen.

97
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:48,520
I pray that every blessing in this prayer
is now upon you in the name of

98
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,420
Jesus. May the grace
and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with

99
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,660
all.

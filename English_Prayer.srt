2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,180
Good morning, Lord. Today's a new day,

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,540
a chance for a new start. Yesterday is

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,280
gone, and with it, any regrets,

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:18,180
mistakes, or failures

6
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:22,960
I may have experienced.
It's a good day to be glad

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,520
and give thanks, and I do, Lord.

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:31,220
Thank you for today,
a new opportunity to love,

9
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:35,340
give, and be all that you want me to be.

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:37,200
Today, I want to start the day

11
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,960
with you on my mind and in my heart.
As I dress,

12
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:46,650
let me wear the armor you've provided
daily: the helmet of

13
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:50,140
salvation,
the breastplate of righteousness,

14
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:54,460
the shield of faith, the belt of truth,
the

15
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,340
shoes of peace,
and the sword of the spirit, with

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:02,240
prayer on my tongue, praise for you, and

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,020
petitions for those around me
and those I meet.

18
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,760
Feed me today with your daily bread.

19
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,600
As the bread of life, your food,
like manna,

20
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,680
will sustain me throughout any trials
and hungers.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,560
Help me to set my thoughts on things above
and to

22
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:23,720
speak only what will help and encourage

23
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,360
others.
Keep me from putting my foot in my mouth

24
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:32,140
and help me guard the affections of my
heart today, Lord.

25
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:36,360
Make whatever work I do be marked with
excellence rather than

26
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,680
perfectionism, as I seek not to make a

27
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,620
name, but to make a difference. Help me to

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,160
treat each person I encounter as you
would, with

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,140
respect and love, forgiving others
and asking for

30
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,980
forgiveness myself when needed.
As I start this

31
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,120
day, help me remember that I belong to

32
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:02,120
you, and my desire is to act accordingly.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,100
Keep my feet from stumbling
and my mind from wandering

34
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:07,300
into distractions

35
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,699
that could steal precious time and energy

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,160
from the most important things you have
designed for me.

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,040
I'm proud to be your child, Lord,
and I'm so

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:23,030
grateful that you died for me,
rising again so that

39
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,000
every day could be filled with the wonder
of your love, the

40
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,200
freedom of your spirit,
and the joy of knowing

41
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,240
you. I know earthly life is short
and fleeting,

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,060
Lord, but I want to live today

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,660
as if it were the first
or the last day of my life,

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,360
giving thanks for every good
and perfect gift you choose to

45
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,360
give. Today, and every day, I want to

46
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,260
live my life for you, Jesus.
In your precious

47
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,820
name, I pray. Amen.

48
00:02:59,780 --> 00:02:59,900
